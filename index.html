        <h4>Written Questions:</h4>
        <p> 
            <b>1. Describe how your dashboard answers the questions presented. You don't have to address every question directly, 
            but should at a high level address the main questions. (10 points)</b> <br/>
            - Question 1: Graph 1 answers the number of title per genre on Netflix using bar graph. Since the genres are set into two categories based on 
            whether they are movie or TV shows, I divide the dataset into two parts: movies versus TV shows when drawing the bar chart. I rank the genres 
            in the number they appear in the dataset to show a descending popularity. The bar chart is a good way when the number of categories is not too
            large and when we want to see the exact numbers clearly.
            <br/> <br/> 
            - Question 2: Graph 2 shows the average runtime of movies in a time scale scatter plot. The graph shows how the average runtime of movies evolute
            as time goes on. The graph shows clearly that the variation in average movie length between years becomes smaller and smaller as the industry standard
            is usually followed to reduce the number of outliers in movie length and as the number of movies per year becomes large enough to cancel the effect
            of outliers (movies that are too long or short).
            <br/><br/> 
            - Question 3: Graph 3 shows how the actors are connected through a network flow with nodes and links. The nodes are actors, and the links between
            nodes shows what movie these two actors have both acted in. Since the number of total actors is enormous for our Neflix dataset, I have filtered 
            the movies to show only movies whose country is "China" in the csv dataset. The larger the node, the more connections an actor has and usually the 
            more movies that she or he has acted in.
        </p>
        <p> <b>2. List 3 reasons why D3 was helpful and improved your visualization (6 points) </b> <br/>
            - (1) First, d3 makes it very convenient to import and process data from csv files. We can use maps and filters to get the processed data easily.
            <br/><br/>
            - (2) Second, d3 supports so many types of graphs that we have abundant options when considering different effects and visualizations.
            <br/><br/>
            - (3)  Third, managing colors in d3 is easy and color scales supported in d3 are very appealing visually.
        </p>
        <p> <b>3. List 3 reasons why D3 would not be the best tool for creating a visualization (6 points)</b> <br/>
            - (1) Compared to Tableau, it requres the users to have strong technical skills in coding and javascript, which may not apply to the majority of people/
            <br/><br/>
            - (2) When the amount of data is huge, it's very time consuming to load the visualization from web pages.
            <br/><br/>
            - (3) d3 graphs does not support all platforms like older browsers or tablets that may not be able to connected to a port. It is not accessible to wider 
            audiences

        </p>
        <p> 
            <b>4. Evaluate the accessibility of your dashboard based on the readings in the ‚ÄúBefore you begin‚Äù section. What kinds of users might find this 
                dashboard accessible and who might have more difficulty? What additional actions might you take to make this dashboard more accessible to all 
                audiences? Your response should refer to at least one of the readings and be about 1 paragraph.</b> <br/>

            - It is apprently true that people who have visual impairment or even blind would not be able to access my visualization. Therefore, I would consider
             adding sound to the page that tells the user what are the conclusion we can draw from the graphs on the page. In ‚ÄùAccessibility is at the Heart of 
             Data Visualization", the author mentioned that we shouldn't rely on a single signal factor for our most important message and repitition is important 
             to deliver the key message. As a result, using both sounds and visuals can be more helpful.
           
        </p>

        <p> 
            <b>5. Reflect on the stages of your design and implementation process when you could have taken steps to make your dashboard more accessible to all 
                audiences. What are some factors that kept you from taking these steps? (a few sentences)</b> <br/>

            - While I could have added sound effects for my dashboard, it would be way too time-consuming and requires technical skills that I am not familiar with.
            Also, people becomes more realistic when they know what the potential audience might be for our dashboard. If we have no idea who this dashboard might
            be presented to, we may consider that people who have impairments.
